Progressive Enhancement: Cutting the Mustard with CSS Media Queries

Cutting the mustard is a key technique in the progressive enhancement paradigm, where the basic experience is delivered to the client and then enhanced based on their preferences and browser compatibility.

The 'Cutting the Mustard' technique is a method of rendering web apps that allows users to be served the lightest pages possible, while ensuring all users, regardless of browser, personal preference or technological restrictions receives a fully usable, functional page that is able to be interacted with.

What is Cutting the Mustard?

Cutting the mustard is the antithesis of another technique called 'Graceful Degradation'. In graceful degradation, enhancements like CSS and Javascript are designed to 'fail gracefully', meaning the client can be delivered large amounts of redundant code that bloats requests, and that we, as developers, must second-guess how different browsers will fail and adjust accordingly, adding time and effort to both the development and QA processes.

A basic implementation of cutting the mustard would involve using Javascript to detect the capabilities of the client browser and then, and only then, adding enchancements where possible, by loading in additional scripts or stylesheets. b
